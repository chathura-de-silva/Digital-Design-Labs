Digital Design Labs covered under "Computer organization and digital design" module in semester 2, UOM CSE

## First 7 Labs are Vivado projects. 
- All are designed for the Basys 3 FPGA.
- Empty directories was kept as it is due to possible conflics with the file paths inside the project files.

## Final lab is related to Assembly language.

## [Final project, The Design of a Nanoprocessor can be found here : [Nanoprocessor_Design](https://github.com/Sharada001/Nanoprocessor_Design)
